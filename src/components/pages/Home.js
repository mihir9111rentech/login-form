        <p>A few weeks ago, we published a blog article featuring 15 examples of brilliant homepage design. And man was it popular! Not even a full three weeks later, the article has already attracted more than 36,000 views. Now, before you accuse us of getting all cocky on you, you should know the other side to the story.</p>
        <p>Albeit successful, many of the readers of that post ... or at least the ones who like leaving blog comments ;-) ... were disappointed in the lack of industry variety in the examples we showcased, since a lot of them featured homepages of software companies. So ... what's a marketer to do? We could either ignore your complaints, or we could follow The Kinks' lead and "give the people what they want."</p>
